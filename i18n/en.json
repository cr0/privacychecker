Think about all your published personal items: Would you also share them with persons you do not know well in real-life? Maybe it is better to keep the items private or share them only with special persons.<br/>You can certainly hide your items from distant acquaintances by using your settings. But if the amount of your friends gets unimaginable vast it might be hard to stay on top of things. As your guess concerning the amount of your friends or your performance in Find Your Friends was not very good this is exactly what might have happened. For this reason, you should think about who you really want to have as a Facebook friend. Friend requests should not be accepted just to be polite. Moreover, you should not be afraid of breaking off a friendship on Facebook."
