# Friend Inspector (formerly known as "privacy checker")
This is the latest version of the source code of the serious game "Friend Inspector" (http://www.friend-inspector.org/).
Note that Friend Inspector is based on essential principles of version 1.0 of the Facebook API. Since Facebook supports this version only until April 30th 2015, Friend Inspector can no longer be operated in its current form.
If you are interested in building some workaround that would make Friend Inspector executable for later versions of the Facebook API, please feel free to contact us at mail@friend-inspector.org for further information.

## building
- volo add
- npm install
- grunt dev && grunt connect
